<img src="/images/profile.jpg" class="left">

My name is Michelle (or Chelle) and I am 24 years old. I live in Cornwall, and since living here, have become slave to two rescued ex-racing greyhounds called Holly and Grace.

I am a current undergraduate student of The Open University. I took my first Science Short Course with the OU in 2008 and finally made the decision to pursue a degree in 2010.

Current study includes S216 (Environmental Science) and SXL288 (Practical Science : Biology and Health) and will count towards the Bsc (Hons) Natural Sciences. This year, I should complete the modules to earn the Diploma in Natural Sciences. Along the way, I have also already achieved the Certificate in Contemporary Science and Certificate in Natural Sciences.

Beyond my science studies, I always liked learning languages and am currently revising and improving my knowledge of the Spanish language. I love music, films and especially books - I have been an avid reader of fiction ever since I was little. 

I enjoy photography (particularly landscape and nature themes) and have been building my portfolio over the last couple of years. Creative writing is another passion of mine, but it is usually neglected in favour of a needle and thread (my sewn crafts!) or other craftwork, such as making hand made soap - which can be messy but is always good fun!

When I do manage to find some spare time, I enjoy cooking new concoctions in the kitchen, then indulging in wine and chocolate with any of my numerous favourite TV series (I have a soft spot for anything in the Whedonverse, I must admit!).
