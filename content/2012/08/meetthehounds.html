Meet Holly and Grace. These two lovely hounds were rescued by the <a href="http://www.retiredgreyhounds.co.uk">Retired Greyhound Trust (RGT)</a> in 2010 and came to join us, their new forever home. Holly was three years old, and Grace was four years old. At such a young age, they ceased to be useful on the racetrack but luckily were saved from cruelty or worse, by the <a href="http://www.retiredgreyhounds.co.uk">RGT</a>. We won't dwell on the plight of greyhounds here, but if you are curious or would like more information, I recommend you visit the <a href="http://www.retiredgreyhounds.co.uk">RGT</a> in the first instance.

Holly and Grace have lived a happy two years with us to date, and as you can imagine - they hog the sofa, tear up the garden with their fast running and have a greater collection of coats than their human minions combined! Holly is a blue (grey) greyhound, with white patches, and Grace is a black greyhound with some white patches, such as on her toes! Both Holly and Grace have unique personalities but when they are together and feel like entertaining themselves by playing up the family, they become worthy of their given nickname, "The Bandits"!
