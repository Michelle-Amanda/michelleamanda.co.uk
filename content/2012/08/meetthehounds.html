Meet Holly and Grace. These two lovely hounds were rescued by the Retired Greyhound Trust in 2010 and came to join us, their new forever home. Both are Irish born and trained ex-racing greyhounds and despite having fairly good racing careers, their careers were both over at a young age as it is with many greyhounds. We won't dwell on the plight of greyhounds here, but if you are curious or would like more information, I recommend you visit the Retired Greyhound Trust [link?] in the first instance.

Holly and Grace have lived a happy two years with us to date, and as you can imagine - they hog the sofa, tear up the garden with their fast running and have a greater collection of coats than their human minions combined!
