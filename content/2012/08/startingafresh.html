So. I have restored my online presence! This is my little corner of the internet again. A place where practicalities won't always reign but where creativity can thrive! 

If you'd like to find out more about me, then head on over to the <a href="/about/">About</a> page. As for the content of this blog; I will be writing about a variety of things - from my Open University studies to my rescue greyhounds, from cooking to craftwork, from random new obsessions to every day life! You name it, at some point, I will probably see fit to bore you all with it! ;)

So for now, welcome! Have a cup of a tea and a slice of cake while you look around. Or if you ask nicely, I'll even open the bar for you!
