&lt;p&gt;Meet Holly and Grace. These two lovely hounds were rescued by the &lt;a href="http://www.retiredgreyhounds.co.uk"&gt;Retired Greyhound Trust (RGT)&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 and came to join us, their new forever home. Holly was three years old, and Grace was four years old. At such a young age, they ceased to be useful on the racetrack but luckily were saved from cruelty or worse, by the &lt;a href="http://www.retiredgreyhounds.co.uk"&gt;RGT&lt;/a&gt;. I won’t dwell on the plight of greyhounds here, but if you are curious or would like more information, I recommend you visit the &lt;a href="http://www.retiredgreyhounds.co.uk"&gt;RGT&lt;/a&gt; in the first instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holly and Grace have lived a happy two years with us to date, and as you can imagine - they hog the sofa, tear up the garden with their fast running and have a greater collection of coats than their human minions combined! Holly is a blue (grey) greyhound, with white patches, and Grace is a black greyhound with some white patches, such as on her toes! Both Holly and Grace have unique personalities but when they are together and feel like entertaining themselves by playing up the family, they become worthy of their given nickname, “The Bandits”!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So. I have restored my online presence! This is my little corner of the internet again. A place where practicalities won’t always reign but where creativity can thrive! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to find out more about me, then head on over to the &lt;a href="/about/"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page. As for the content of this blog; I will be writing about a variety of things - from my Open University studies to my rescue greyhounds, from cooking to craftwork, from random new obsessions to every day life! You name it, at some point, I will probably see fit to bore you all with it! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for now, welcome! Have a cup of a tea and a slice of cake while you look around. Or if you ask nicely, I’ll even open the bar for you!&lt;/p&gt;
