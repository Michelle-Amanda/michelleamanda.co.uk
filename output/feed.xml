&lt;p&gt;Meet Holly and Grace. These two lovely hounds were rescued by the Retired Greyhound Trust in 2010 and came to join us, their new forever home. Both are Irish born and trained ex-racing greyhounds and despite having fairly good racing careers, their careers were both over at a young age as it is with many greyhounds. We won’t dwell on the plight of greyhounds here, but if you are curious or would like more information, I recommend you visit the Retired Greyhound Trust [link?] in the first instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holly and Grace have lived a happy two years with us to date, and as you can imagine - they hog the sofa, tear up the garden with their fast running and have a greater collection of coats than their human minions combined!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So. apparently I have restored my online presence! I’m not really a stranger to starting again! When I was younger I used to build and rebuild websites from dawn until dusk. In my late teens and twenties, it has been my life that has needed remodelling! When you’re younger, everything in life seems dramatic and I remember spending almost every day fretting over one thing or another. Now I’m a little older, I still fret but about totally different and very often - totally boring practicalities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my little corner of the internet again. A place where practicalities won’t always reign but where creativity can thrive! I will more than likely blog a variety of things - from my Open University studies to my rescue greyhounds, from cooking to craftwork, from random new obsessions to every day life! You name it, at some point, I will probably see fit to bore you all with it! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for now, welcome! Have a cup of a tea and a slice of cake while you look around. Or if you ask nicely, I’ll even open the bar for you!&lt;/p&gt;
